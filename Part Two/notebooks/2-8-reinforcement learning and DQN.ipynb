    "## Introduction\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful machine learning paradigm inspired by how agents learn to act in an environment through trial and error. In this notebook, we explore the core concepts of RL, the Bellman equation, and Deep Q-Networks (DQN). We will train an agent using DQN on the classic CartPole-v1 environment from OpenAI's `gym`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Makes Reinforcement Learning Special?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike supervised learning where we have labeled data (like pictures of cats labeled \"cat\"), or unsupervised learning where we find patterns in data, reinforcement learning is about **learning from interaction**. Think of it like learning to ride a bicycle:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You don't have a dataset of \"correct\" bicycle movements\n",
    "- You learn by trying, falling, and adjusting\n",
    "- You get feedback (rewards) - staying balanced feels good, falling hurts\n",
    "- Over time, you develop a strategy (policy) for riding successfully\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Examples of Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Video Games**: Game AI that learns to play chess, Go, or video games\n",
    "2. **Robotics**: Robots learning to walk, grasp objects, or navigate\n",
    "3. **Finance**: Trading algorithms that learn optimal investment strategies\n",
    "4. **Healthcare**: Treatment planning that adapts to patient responses\n",
    "5. **Autonomous Vehicles**: Learning to drive safely in various conditions"

    "## Reinforcement Learning Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "### The RL Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're playing a video game. At each moment:\n",
    "1. You see the current game screen (the **state**)\n",
    "2. You decide what button to press (the **action**)\n",
    "3. The game responds with points and a new screen (the **reward** and **next state**)\n",
    "\n",
    "This cycle continues until the game ends. RL algorithms learn to maximize the total score!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "An RL problem is typically modeled as a **Markov Decision Process (MDP)**. The agent interacts with an environment over discrete time steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **State (s)**: Current situation of the agent.\n",
    "- **Action (a)**: Choices available to the agent.\n",
    "- **Reward (r)**: Feedback from the environment.\n",
    "- **Policy (œÄ)**: Strategy used by the agent.\n",
    "- **Q-Value**: Expected future rewards given a state and action.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding States, Actions, and Rewards\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use a simple example: **Teaching a Dog to Fetch**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **States**: Where is the ball? Where is the dog? Is the dog holding the ball?\n",
    "- **Actions**: Run forward, turn left/right, pick up ball, drop ball\n",
    "- **Rewards**: \n",
    "  - +10 for bringing ball back to owner\n",
    "  - +1 for picking up the ball\n",
    "  - -0.1 for each time step (encourages efficiency)\n",
    "  - -5 for running into obstacles\n",
    "\n",
    "The dog (agent) learns which actions in which states lead to the most treats (rewards)!"

    "## Markov Decision Process (MDP)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the Markov Property?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Markov property states that **\"the future depends only on the present, not the past.\"** In other words, if you know the current state, you have all the information needed to predict what happens next.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Example: Weather Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a simplified weather system with only three states:\n",
    "- ‚òÄÔ∏è Sunny\n",
    "- ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloudy \n",
    "- üåßÔ∏è Rainy\n",
    "\n",
    "With the Markov property, tomorrow's weather depends ONLY on today's weather, not on last week's weather pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Today is Sunny ‚Üí Tomorrow: 70% Sunny, 20% Cloudy, 10% Rainy\n",
    "Today is Cloudy ‚Üí Tomorrow: 30% Sunny, 40% Cloudy, 30% Rainy\n",
    "Today is Rainy ‚Üí Tomorrow: 20% Sunny, 30% Cloudy, 50% Rainy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is this Important for RL?\n",
    "\n",
    "In our CartPole example:\n",
    "- The **state** includes: cart position, cart velocity, pole angle, pole velocity\n",
    "- This state contains ALL information needed to decide the next action\n",
    "- We don't need to know how the pole got to this angle - just the current state!\n",
    "\n",
    "### MDP Components\n",
    "\n",
    "A Markov Decision Process consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **S**: Set of all possible states\n",
    "2. **A**: Set of all possible actions\n",
    "3. **P(s'|s,a)**: Probability of reaching state s' from state s after taking action a\n",
    "4. **R(s,a,s')**: Reward received for going from state s to s' via action a\n",
    "5. **Œ≥ (gamma)**: Discount factor (0 ‚â§ Œ≥ ‚â§ 1) - how much we value future rewards\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Discount Factor (Œ≥)\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we discount future rewards? Consider this choice:\n",
    "- Option A: Get $100 today\n",
    "- Option B: Get $100 in one year\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people prefer Option A! In RL:\n",
    "- Œ≥ = 0: Only care about immediate rewards (very short-sighted)\n",
    "- Œ≥ = 0.9: Future rewards are worth 90% of immediate rewards\n",
    "- Œ≥ = 1: Future rewards are just as valuable as immediate rewards\n",
    "\n",
    "In our code, we use Œ≥ = 0.95, meaning rewards 10 steps in the future are worth about 60% of immediate rewards (0.95^10 ‚âà 0.60)."

    "### What is a Q-Value?\n",

    "\n",
    "You're at an intersection (state) and can go:\n",
    "- **Left** (action 1): Usually fast, but sometimes has traffic\n",
    "- **Right** (action 2): Always slow but reliable\n",
    "- **Straight** (action 3): Medium speed, occasional construction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Q-values might be:\n",
    "- Q(intersection, left) = -15 minutes (average time)\n",
    "- Q(intersection, right) = -20 minutes\n",
    "- Q(intersection, straight) = -17 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "The best action is 'left' because it has the highest Q-value (least negative = shortest time)!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The Q-function is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q^\\pi(s,a) = \\mathbb{E}[R_t + \\gamma R_{t+1} + \\gamma^2 R_{t+2} + ... | S_t = s, A_t = a]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $Q^\\pi(s,a)$ is the Q-value for state s and action a under policy œÄ\n",
    "- $\\mathbb{E}$ means \"expected value\" (average)\n",
    "- $R_t, R_{t+1}, ...$ are future rewards\n",
    "- $\\gamma$ is the discount factor\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Q-Values are Powerful\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we know all Q-values, choosing actions is easy:\n",
    "- Just pick the action with the highest Q-value!\n",

    "1. **Experience Replay Memory**\n",
    "   - `self.memory = deque(maxlen=2000)`: Stores past experiences\n",
    "   - Why? Learning from random samples breaks correlation between consecutive experiences\n",
    "   - Like studying with flashcards in random order vs. sequential order\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Neural Network Architecture**\n",
    "   - Input layer: 4 neurons (state size)\n",
    "   - Hidden layers: Two layers with 24 neurons each\n",
    "   - Output layer: 2 neurons (one Q-value per action)\n",
    "   - Activation: ReLU for hidden layers, linear for output\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Epsilon-Greedy Strategy**\n",
    "   - `self.epsilon = 1.0`: Start with 100% exploration\n",
    "   - `self.epsilon_decay = 0.995`: Reduce exploration by 0.5% each time\n",
    "   - `self.epsilon_min = 0.01`: Always keep 1% exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Learning Process**\n",
    "   - **Act**: Choose action using current policy\n",
    "   - **Step**: Execute action, observe reward and next state\n",
    "   - **Remember**: Store experience in memory\n",
    "   - **Replay**: Learn from random batch of past experiences\n",

    "1. Reset environment to starting position\n",
    "2. Until pole falls or time limit:\n",

    "   - Environment responds with new state and reward\n",

    "## Practical Tips and Common Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Might Training Fail?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Too Much Exploration**: If epsilon stays high, agent keeps acting randomly\n",
    "2. **Too Little Exploration**: Agent gets stuck in suboptimal strategy\n",
    "3. **Poor Reward Design**: In our code, we give -10 for falling (encourages survival)\n",
    "4. **Insufficient Memory**: Small replay buffer might not capture diverse experiences\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hyperparameters to Tune\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Learning Rate** (0.001): How big are the weight updates?\n",
    "  - Too high: Unstable learning\n",
    "  - Too low: Slow learning\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Batch Size** (32): How many experiences to learn from at once?\n",
    "  - Larger: More stable but slower\n",
    "  - Smaller: Faster but noisier\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Network Size** (24 neurons √ó 2 layers): Model complexity\n",
    "  - Larger: Can learn complex patterns but might overfit\n",
    "  - Smaller: Faster, but might not capture all patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Signs of Successful Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Increasing Average Score**: Rolling average improves over time\n",
    "2. **Decreasing Variance**: Performance becomes more consistent\n",
    "3. **Strategic Behavior**: Agent develops recognizable patterns (e.g., gentle corrections)\n",
    "4. **Robust Performance**: Agent handles various starting conditions"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explored the fundamental concepts of reinforcement learning and implemented a Deep Q-Network (DQN) using TensorFlow and OpenAI Gym. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **RL is Learning from Interaction**: Unlike supervised learning, RL agents learn by trying and receiving feedback\n",
    "2. **Markov Property Simplifies Problems**: Future depends only on present, not entire history\n",
    "3. **Q-Values Guide Decisions**: They tell us the long-term value of actions\n",
    "4. **Neural Networks Enable Scaling**: DQN can handle complex, continuous state spaces\n",
    "5. **Balance is Key**: Exploration vs exploitation, immediate vs future rewards\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Try modifying hyperparameters and observe the effects\n",
    "- Implement improvements like target networks or double DQN\n",
    "- Apply DQN to other Gym environments (MountainCar, LunarLander)\n",
    "- Explore policy gradient methods for continuous action spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: RL is as much art as science. Experiment, observe, and iterate!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercises for Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modify the Reward**: What happens if you give +0.1 for staying centered?\n",
    "2. **Change Network Architecture**: Try 3 hidden layers or different sizes\n",
    "3. **Adjust Exploration**: What if epsilon decays faster or slower?\n",
    "4. **Visualize Q-Values**: Plot how Q-values change during training\n",
    "5. **Compare Algorithms**: Implement a simple Q-table for CartPole (discretize states)"
